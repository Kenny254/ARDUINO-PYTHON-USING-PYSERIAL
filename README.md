*Python Programming Language
Python is a high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It's widely used in various fields such as web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more. Python's versatility and extensive libraries make it a popular choice for beginners and professionals alike.

*Arduino Open-Source Boards
Arduino is an open-source hardware and software platform designed for building electronics projects. It consists of a microcontroller board (such as Arduino Uno, Arduino Nano, etc.) and an integrated development environment (IDE) for writing and uploading code to the board. Arduino simplifies the process of creating interactive objects or environments by providing easy-to-use hardware and software interfaces.

*Concept Introduction
The concept here involves controlling an LED connected to an Arduino Uno board using Python running on a computer. Python sends commands over a serial connection to the Arduino, instructing it to turn the LED on or off.

*Requirements
Arduino Uno board
LED
Resistor (220 ohms recommended)
Jumper wires
Breadboard (optional)
Software:
Arduino IDE
Python (with PySerial library installed)
